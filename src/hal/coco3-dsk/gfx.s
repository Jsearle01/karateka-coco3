* HAL Graphics subsystem — P2.3a implementation.
*
* Purpose:
*   HAL_gfx_init: initialize GIME for 320x192x4 double-buffered mode.
*   HAL_gfx_clear: fill active back buffer with palette index 0.
*   HAL_gfx_present: display buffer page_register identifies; swap displayed/draw buffers.
*
* Adapted from refs/GFXMODE3.ASM (Jay-authored, November 2025,
*   MAME-verified at authorship). Adaptation per P1.6 frame buffer
*   layout ($8000/$C000 instead of asm's $6000/$A000). EDTASM
*   single-quote operand comments converted to lwasm ';' syntax.
*   asm's START routine (ORCC, LDS, TFR A,DP) NOT ported here —
*   those are boot responsibilities, not HAL_gfx_init's job per A3.
*   asm's $FF90-last order REVERSED: P1.6 $8000/$C000 buffers are
*   in ROM territory; $FF90 must fire FIRST (see Step 1 note).

* P3 REPLACEMENT NOTES:
*   HAL_gfx_present: P2.3a.6-followup-1 implemented real VOFFSET swap.
*     P3 may refine to VBL-gated swap (HAL_time_vbl_wait integration).
*   HAL_gfx_init: P3 may add real MMU slot programming when A7 is
*     discharged (currently accepted as MAME-default MMU floor per plan
*     §A4/A7). HAL_gfx_init calls omitted per plan §4.4.
*
* METHODOLOGY OPEN ITEM (non-blocking):
*   $FF90/$FFD9/$FFDF register values are empirically known-good from
*   GFXMODE3.ASM (MAME-verified Nov 2025). Bit-level derivation from
*   GIME-RM not completed in P2.3a; carried forward as R4/R5 debt.
*   [no-ref: $FF90 INIT0 bit semantics from GIME-RM §4 — discharge P2.3a.1]
*   [no-ref: $FFD9/$FFDF SAM clock/RAM semantics — discharge P2.3a.1]
*
* ERR_NOMEM clause: HAL_gfx_init contract specifies ERR_NOMEM if frame
*   buffers cannot be allocated. In P2.3a, frame buffers are statically
*   allocated per P1.6 memory map ($8000-$BBFF, $C000-$FBFF). No
*   dynamic allocation; ERR_NOMEM is never returned. HAL_gfx_init
*   always returns CC.C clear in this implementation.

* --- Step 1: Activate CoCo3 mode ($FF90) — MUST BE FIRST ---
* GIME INIT ORDERING CONSTRAINTS (empirical, per GFXMODE3.ASM Nov 2025):
*
*   CONSTRAINT A — $FF90 written FIRST:
*     Our framebuffers are at $8000-$FBFF (ROM territory under CoCo1/2 map).
*     $FF90=$4C transitions to CoCo3 map (COCO=0, all-RAM) so the framebuffer
*     is accessible. GFXMODE3 wrote $FF90 last because its framebuffers
*     ($6000-$9BFF) are accessible under either map type. We cannot.
*     [ref: GFXMODE3.ASM line 53-54 — LDA #$4C / STA $FF90]
*
*   CONSTRAINT B — Palette ($FFB0-$FFB3) written LAST:
*     Empirical observation from GFXMODE3 development (P2.3a.6-followup-3).
*     Palette writes do not appear to latch correctly until the GIME's video
*     mode ($FF98/$FF99) is in its final 4-color state. Writing palette before
*     $FF98/$FF99 causes indices 1-2 to render as black regardless of value.
*     NOT documented in SockmasterGime.md; inferred from working GFXMODE3 vs
*     broken pre-reorder HAL_gfx_init. Combined constraint:
*     $FF90 first → clear buffers → mode → VOFFSET → VSCROL → HOFFSET → SAM
*     → palette LAST.
*     [ref: GFXMODE3.ASM lines 48-64 — mode-before-palette ordering]
*
*   IEN PRESERVATION NOTE (HAL_gfx_init IEN fix, 2026-05-20):
*     Value written is $6C, not $4C. $6C = $4C | $20 (adds IEN=1, bit 5).
*     GFXMODE3.ASM used $4C (IEN=0) which is sufficient for a standalone
*     demo without interrupts. karateka-coco3 requires IEN=1 because
*     HAL_time_init (init order step 2) writes $FF90=$6C to enable GIME VBL
*     interrupts; HAL_gfx_init at step 3 must not clobber that bit.
*
*     $FF90 is write-only (reads return hardware status, not last-written
*     value; [ref: docs/project/interrupt-handling.md §8.4]). Read-modify-write is
*     impossible. All bits this function requires are preserved in $6C:
*     COCO=0, MMUEN=1, IEN=1, FEN=0, MC3=1, MC2=1, MC1=0, MC0=0.
*
*     Coupling: this value assumes IEN=1 is the correct state after
*     HAL_time_init. Safe for standalone drivers that omit HAL_time_init:
*     such drivers keep CC.I=1 throughout (per Q001.4/4.c — never opt in
*     to real-VBL). CPU never services IRQ regardless of GIME assertion
*     state, so IEN=1 is harmless in this configuration.

                ifdef   HAL_GFX_MODE_SERVICE
* P2.5 KERNEL SERVICE -- compiled where a project asks for it.
* ONE shared source, per-project CONFIGURATION (governance rule 3), the same
* mechanism as the runtime-blit dormancy guard. POP defines the flag in its
* build.bat; karateka does not YET, so its absolute binary stays byte-identical
* and adopting the service later is a one-flag change, not a port.
* ===============================================================
* HAL_gfx_set_mode  [P2.5 — the first real kernel GRAPHICS SERVICE]
*
* Switch the display to a requested graphics mode. This generalizes the
* register programming that HAL_gfx_init hardcodes for 320x192x4.
*
* Args:    A = mode id (GFX_MODE_320x192x4 = 0, GFX_MODE_320x192x16 = 1)
*              Out-of-range falls back to mode 0, same documented behaviour
*              as HAL_gfx_init's palette-descriptor argument.
* Returns: CC.C clear (always succeeds; no failure mode exists — every
*          supported mode is statically allocatable).
* Preserves: U, Y   [per the hal.inc calling convention]
* Clobbers:  A, B, X, CC
*
* GUARANTEE TO THE CALLER, on return:
*   - display is in the requested mode
*   - the framebuffer is CLEARED to palette index 0
*   - that mode's palette is loaded
*   - HAL_gfx_cur_* describe the active geometry
*   - ready to draw. NOTHING carries over from the previous mode.
*
* WHY CLEAR-ON-SWITCH IS THE CONTRACT, not a convenience:
*   The two modes pack pixels differently (4 px/byte vs 2 px/byte). Surviving
*   pixels would not be "old content" under the new mode — they would be
*   reinterpreted as garbage at a different width. There is no meaningful way
*   to preserve them, so the service defines the slate as clean and the caller
*   never has to wonder.
*
* MODE VALUES — CONFIRMED FROM THE REFERENCE, NOT DERIVED (P2.5 §0.2):
*   [ref: docs/ground-truth/GIME_Reference_Manual.pdf §10 Video Mode Reference]
*     "320 x lines | 16 | 4 | 160 | 111 | 10 | $1E"   <- 192-line column
*     "320 x lines |  4 | 2 |  80 | 101 | 01 | $15"
*   [ref: docs/ground-truth/SockmasterGime.md:108-136 — $FF99 bit layout]
*     bits 6-5 LPF  00 = 192 scan lines
*     bits 4-2 HRES 111 = 160 bytes/row ; 101 = 80 bytes/row
*     bits 1-0 CRES  10 = 16 colours (2 px/byte) ; 01 = 4 colours (4 px/byte)
*   Both sources agree independently: $1E = %0 00 111 10.
*
* GEOMETRY DIFFERS AND IT IS NOT SUBTLE:
*   4-colour : 2 bpp,  80 B/row, 192 rows = 15,360 B ($3C00)
*   16-colour: 4 bpp, 160 B/row, 192 rows = 30,720 B ($7800)  <- DOUBLE
*   A caller that draws with the wrong stride does not fail loudly; it draws a
*   skewed diagonal. Hence HAL_gfx_cur_stride, published rather than assumed.
*
* SINGLE-BUFFERED BY CONSTRUCTION (P2.5 scope):
*   The framebuffer is FB_A ($8000) and VOFFSET points at it. 16-colour
*   double-buffering would need 2 x 30,720 = 60 KB of the 64 KB CPU window,
*   which is a real constraint for later animation work. NOT solved here;
*   recorded so the number is on the table when it matters.
*
* ORDERING — the codebase's empirically-proven sequence is used, and it
* DIFFERS from GIME-RM §14's generic example. Two deliberate divergences:
*   (1) $FF90 FIRST. Our framebuffer lives at $8000+, which is ROM territory
*       under the CoCo1/2 map, so the CoCo3 all-RAM map must exist before the
*       clear can write anything. GIME-RM's example uses $6000 and can afford
*       to write $FF90 late. We cannot. [HAL_gfx_init CONSTRAINT A]
*   (2) PALETTE LAST. GIME-RM §14 loads the palette at step 4, before the mode
*       registers. This codebase found empirically that palette writes do not
*       latch until $FF98/$FF99 hold their final values — indices render black
*       otherwise. [HAL_gfx_init CONSTRAINT B, MAME-verified]
*   Per CLAUDE.md §2, observed behaviour outranks documentation: the trace wins
*   on fact, the manual wins on intent. Recorded here so the divergence reads
*   as a decision rather than an oversight.
* ===============================================================
* The MODE IDs themselves live in hal.inc, not here — they are contract, not
* implementation. A caller that includes only the contract must be able to name
* the mode it wants; this file never uses them by name because its table is
* positional (row 0 = mode 0, row 1 = mode 1). One home each.
*   [ref: src/hal.inc — GFX_MODE_320x192x4 / GFX_MODE_320x192x16]
* ★★ GFX_MODE_MAX AND THE DESCRIPTOR TABLE ARE PROJECT-LOCAL (POP-HAL-01).
* They moved to src/hal/coco3-dsk/hal_globals.s, which hal_sync_check.py lists as
* PROJECT_LOCAL. The reason is not tidiness: this file is SHARED, and a shared table is a
* shared BINARY -- adding one 7-byte row for another project shifted every address after it
* and changed 27 of POP's artifacts. Shared mechanism, project-local data.
*
* ★★★ REQUIREMENT, DOCUMENTED RATHER THAN GUARDED: a project that defines
* HAL_GFX_MODE_SERVICE MUST define GFX_MODE_MAX and gfx_mode_table in its own hal_globals.s.
* Omit them and lwasm fails with "Undefined symbol gfx_mode_table" -- which NAMES the missing
* thing at assembly time. A guard was considered and rejected: it would replace a loud,
* self-describing failure with either a silent compile-out (the service present but inert) or
* a second symbol every project must keep in sync, which is more coupling, not less.
*

* ===============================================================
* DOUBLE-BUFFER GEOMETRY (P2.6) — ONE model, BOTH modes.
*
* THE CORRECTION THIS RESTS ON. P2.5 shipped this service single-buffered and
* recorded a worry that 16-colour double-buffering would need 60 KB of the 64 KB
* CPU window. That was WRONG, and the error was reasoning about the CPU's view
* instead of the machine's. Framebuffers live in PHYSICAL RAM addressed by the
* GIME's VOFFSET register; the CPU only ever sees an MMU-mapped window onto part
* of it. There is no 60 KB wall and no forced choice — 16-colour double-buffers
* exactly like 4-colour, with bigger buffers at different physical addresses.
*
* PHYSICAL RAM: 512 KB, $00000-$7FFFF, blocks $00-$3F (8 KB each).
*   CONFIRMED, not assumed: `mame coco3 -listxml` reports
*   <ramoption name="512K" default="yes">524288</ramoption>.
*
* PLACEMENT — deliberately AWAY from the default-mapped top 64 KB:
*   buffer A  physical $20000  blocks $10-$13   VOFFSET $20000/8 = $4000
*   buffer B  physical $30000  blocks $18-$1B   VOFFSET $30000/8 = $6000
*   32 KB reserved per buffer, which is the 16-colour size (30,720 B) rounded up
*   to the 8 KB block granularity. 4-colour uses 15,360 B of the same reservation.
*
*   WHY NOT THE TOP 64 KB. The CoCo3 boots with CPU $0000-$FFFF mapped to physical
*   $70000-$7FFFF, so a buffer placed there overlaps the running program: this
*   program loads at CPU $0200 = physical $70200 and its kernel at CPU $3000 =
*   physical $73000. Drawing into such a buffer would overwrite the code doing the
*   drawing. Blocks $10-$1B are in the 448 KB the default map never touches.
*
* THE DRAW WINDOW: the BACK buffer is always mapped at CPU $6000 through MMU
* registers $FFA3-$FFA6 (CPU $6000-$DFFF, 32 KB).
*   [ref: GIME-RM §2 — $FFA0-$FFA7 MMU task set 0]
*   $FFA3 -> $6000  $FFA4 -> $8000  $FFA5 -> $A000  $FFA6 -> $C000
*
*   WHY $8000 (MOVED from $6000 in P3.2). The first real screen carries a 26,880-byte
*   image asset; a program loading at $0200 with that much data runs past $6000, into
*   the window itself. Moving the window to $8000 ($FFA4-$FFA7) gives the program
*   $0200..$7FFF and keeps the two apart.
*
*   The cost is that $FFA7 (CPU $E000-$FFFF) is now remapped, which P2.6 deliberately
*   avoided because that block holds the stack and vector area. Two facts make it
*   safe and BOTH must hold: $FF00-$FFFF is ALWAYS I/O regardless of the MMU, and
*   MC3=1 in $FF90 holds $FE00-$FEFF constant, so the secondary vectors are not
*   remapped either. What IS remapped is $E000-$FDFF, which the framebuffer
*   legitimately occupies ($8000 + $7800 = $F800).
*
*   THE CALLER REQUIREMENT MOVES WITH IT: the stack must now be BELOW $8000, not
*   merely outside $6000-$DFFF.
*
* CALLERS DRAW AT HAL_gfx_draw_base AND NEVER AT A BUFFER ADDRESS. The physical
* addresses above are HAL-private on purpose: a caller that learns one of them
* would be writing to whichever buffer happens to be mapped, which is a bug that
* only shows up as a tear.

* THE TWO BUFFERS ARE ADJACENT, AND THAT IS A 128 KB REQUIREMENT (POP P3.10).
* The GIME masks a block number to the RAM actually installed, so on a 128 KB

*
* B at $18 is fine on 512 KB and fatal on 128 KB: the port loaded, started, and

* HAL_gfx_swap  [P2.6 — the VBL-synced buffer flip]
*
* Show the buffer the caller just drew, then map the other one in as the new
* draw target. This is the whole point of double-buffering: the caller never
* draws into memory the GIME is scanning out.
*
* Args:    none
* Returns: CC.C clear (always succeeds)
* Preserves: U, Y
* Clobbers:  A, B, X, CC
*
* ORDER MATTERS, AND IT IS NOT ARBITRARY:
*   1. WAIT for vertical blank. Writing VOFFSET mid-scanline switches the
*      GIME's source address while it is drawing, which is a visible tear —
*      the top of the frame comes from one buffer and the bottom from the
*      other. Waiting is what makes the flip atomic to the eye.
*   2. WRITE VOFFSET to the just-drawn buffer, which becomes the front.
*   3. TOGGLE the back index and MAP that buffer into the window, so the
*      caller's next draw lands in the newly hidden half.
*
* THE CC.I TRAP — the one thing that silently un-does all of this:
*   HAL_time_vbl_wait has a documented fallback (Q001 N3=beta). If CC.I is SET,
*   it does NOT wait — it synthesises a frame-counter increment and returns
*   immediately. A caller that leaves interrupts masked therefore gets a swap
*   loop that runs flat out at CPU speed and flips VOFFSET at arbitrary raster
*   positions. It compiles, it runs, the counters advance, and it tears.
*   The caller MUST install the handler (HAL_time_init) and CLEAR CC.I
*   (andcc #$EF) before animating. HAL_time_init deliberately does not clear it
*   (the E1.c invariant: HAL init never changes the caller's mask state), so
*   this is the caller's job and nothing will remind them.

* HAL_gfx_mirror — make the FRONT buffer identical to the BACK one.
*
* WHY THIS EXISTS (POP P3.17). A page-flipping caller that draws a small animation
* over a STILL background needs that background in both buffers, and the obvious way
* to get it there is to produce it twice. The cutscene room did exactly that and Jay
* saw the cost: the room was swapped into view as soon as it existed, and the second
* copy was then built while the finished picture sat on screen -- first as a second
* disk read (~2 s), then, once that was removed, as a second LZ expand (15 frames,
* 0.25 s). Both are the same shape of bug: work done AFTER the reveal that the viewer
* has to wait through.
*
* Copying is strictly cheaper than reproducing, and doing it BEFORE the first swap
* costs the viewer nothing at all, because the screen is still black. The caller
* builds its picture once, calls this, and swaps -- and both buffers are ready at the
* instant anything becomes visible.
*
* HOW BOTH BUFFERS ARE MAPPED AT ONCE. Normally they cannot be: the window is 32 KB
* and gfx_map_blocks fills all four blocks with ONE buffer, which is what keeps a
* caller from ever writing to the displayed page by accident. But a 4-colour
* framebuffer is 15,360 B -- under half the window -- so the two fit side by side:
* back at $8000, front at $C000. That is a property of the MODE, not of the HAL, so
* this routine CHECKS it rather than assuming it, and refuses in 16-colour where a
* 30,720 B framebuffer needs all four blocks to itself.
*
* The destination top is $C000+15,360 = $FC00, which stays below the $FE00 constant-
* RAM boundary. 16-colour would need $10000 and is exactly what the guard rejects.
*
* Entry: nothing. Exit: CC.C clear = mirrored, CC.C set = refused (mode too large).
* Clobbers: A, B, X, and restores the normal single-buffer mapping either way.

* Clobbers: A, B, X
* ---------------------------------------------------------------
* INTERRUPTS MASKED ACROSS THE WHOLE REMAP -- this is a CRITICAL SECTION.
*
* Writing GFX_DB_BLOCKS MMU registers is a MULTI-STEP update of the CPU memory
* map. Between the first write and the last, the window is half old buffer and
* half new. An interrupt taken in that gap runs with a memory map that never
* legitimately exists; nothing about the handler is wrong, the machine underneath
* it is inconsistent.
*
* MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (P2.9). With the remap unmasked, a probe drawing fast
* enough to keep landing in that window fails reproducibly under the DECB load
* path; masking ONLY these four writes makes it pass 27/27. Two earlier theories
* (stack-clobber, ROM-residency) were killed by measurement before this one was
* confirmed by it -- and the variable was SPEED, which is what pointed at an
* asynchronous interaction in the first place.
*
* THE DISCIPLINE IS KARATEKA-S, NOT NEW. HAL_time_frame_count masks IRQ around
* its two-byte read of the interrupt-updated frame counter for exactly this
* reason: the 6809 offers no atomicity across multiple accesses, so any state the
* interrupt context can observe part-way through must be made atomic by masking.
* [ref: src/hal/coco3-dsk/time.s -- HAL_time_frame_count, the R-vbl race fix]
*
* CC is saved/restored, so a caller that had interrupts masked stays masked (the
* E1.c invariant: HAL routines never change the caller mask state).

* RGB, NOT COMPOSITE. CLAUDE.md §4 makes RGB (screen_config=1) the project's
* monitor gate, and POP ships dist/mame-cfg/rgb/coco3.cfg to force it. The same
* byte decodes to a different colour in composite mode — that mismatch is
* exactly what made orange read as yellow in P1.3 before the gate was set.
*
* These are DIAGNOSTIC palettes chosen so the colour COUNT is visible at a

HAL_gfx_clear:
* ★★★ THE GEOMETRY IS ASKED FOR, NOT ASSUMED (P5.18). This routine took BOTH of its
* facts from the FOUR-COLOUR layout: the BASE from page_register ($8000 or $C000), and the
* LENGTH from a fixed GFX_FB_WORDS. Both are right for 320x192x4, where two whole 15,360 B
* framebuffers sit side by side in one window. Mode 1 is 320x192x16 -- ONE 30,720 B buffer
* across all four blocks -- and there $C000 is not a second page at all: it is the BOTTOM
* HALF of the only one. So this cleared the bottom half of the picture and left the top,
* which is exactly what Jay reported: "the bottom half of the screen ... disappears".
*
* ★★ set_mode ALREADY CLAIMED THIS WAS TRUE, where it publishes the geometry: "Callers read
* these; THE CLEAR BELOW USES THEM TOO, so there is exactly one source for how big is the
* screen and it cannot disagree with itself." It did not use them. The invariant was stated,
* believed, and never held -- which is why it survived: nothing that ran was wrong until a
* 16-colour caller appeared, and POP's first one arrived at P5.16e.
*
* ★ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS HAL_gfx_mirror'S, deliberately -- that routine already decides this
* same question the same way ("16-colour: no room for two at once"), and two different tests
* for one fact is how they drift apart.
*
* ★★ AND THE MODE SERVICE IS OPTIONAL, WHICH SHAPES THE WHOLE ROUTINE. HAL_gfx_cur_words
* and HAL_gfx_draw_base live inside `ifdef HAL_GFX_MODE_SERVICE`; this routine sits after its
* endc. POP defines the guard (build.bat) and karateka does not, so with the guard OFF those
* symbols do not exist and the old fixed-size path is not merely acceptable, it is the only
* one that resolves -- and it is CORRECT there, because without a mode service there is one
* mode and $1E00 is its size. Guard off, the code below assembles to exactly what it always
* did, byte for byte.

* HAL_gfx_present  [P2.3a.5 real implementation]
*
* Swap the GIME-displayed buffer by writing VOFFSET ($FF9D/$FF9E).
* Reads page_register (DP $50) — the CURRENT BACK BUFFER (active draw
* target) — then writes VOFFSET so GIME displays that buffer, making
* the just-drawn content visible.
*
* Option I convention (P2.3a.6-followup-1 — canonical):
*   page_register holds the BACK buffer (draw target). HAL_gfx_present
*   displays the buffer page_register identifies (the one just drawn to).
*   Caller flow: draw → HAL_gfx_present → toggle page_register for next draw.
*
*   PAGE_A_TOKEN ($20) → buffer A was the draw target.
*                        HAL_gfx_present writes VOFFSET for Frame A
*                        ($F000/$00). GIME displays Frame A.
*   PAGE_B_TOKEN ($40) → buffer B was the draw target.
*                        HAL_gfx_present writes VOFFSET for Frame B
*                        ($F800/$00). GIME displays Frame B.
*
* CONVENTION NOTE: "page_register" identifies the BACK buffer (draw
*   target). Convention established in P2.1 with timer_framesync.s.
*   See docs/project/conventions.md §2 frame-coherent band.
*
* NOTE on PAGE_A_TOKEN ($20) / PAGE_B_TOKEN ($40): Apple II heritage.
*   On Apple II, $20/$40 are the high bytes of hires page base addresses
*   ($2000/$4000). On CoCo3 they are opaque draw-target tokens; they have
*   no CoCo3 hardware significance.
*   [ref: src/engine/globals.s — token declarations and heritage note]
*
* CALLER CONTRACT (Option I):
*   - Caller draws to the buffer page_register points at.
*   - Caller calls HAL_gfx_present — displays the just-drawn buffer.
*   - Caller toggles page_register to designate the new draw target.
*   - HAL_gfx_present does NOT modify page_register.
*
* NO VBL gating. This implementation writes VOFFSET immediately without
* waiting for vertical blanking. Tearing may occur if called mid-scanline.
* VBL synchronization is deferred to P3.2.
*
* VOFFSET derivation:
*   Frame A physical $78000: VOFFSET = $78000/8 = $F000 → $FF9D=$F0,$FF9E=$00

* HAL_gfx_blit_sprite  [P2.4.1 sub-byte runtime shifter]
*
* Blit a CoCo3 packed sprite into the active back buffer at a sub-byte-
* precise position. Implements runtime pixel-shift equivalent to the
* Apple II Karateka L1A84 mechanism (karateka_dissasembly_claude/
* src/video.s lines 391-492).
*
* Sprite data format (per P1.2 / tools/sprite_convert.py):
*   byte 0:  height (number of rows)
*   byte 1:  coco3_width (bytes per row; 4 pixels per byte, 2bpp MSB-first)
*   bytes 2+: packed bitmap, row-major, top-to-bottom
*
* Sub-byte shift mechanism (CoCo3 2bpp, 4 pixels per byte):
*   subbyte=0: no shift; byte-aligned blit (fast path)
*   subbyte=1: 2-bit right shift; output=src>>2, overflow=(src&0x03)<<6
*   subbyte=2: 4-bit right shift; output=src>>4, overflow=(src&0x0F)<<4
*   subbyte=3: 6-bit right shift; output=src>>6, overflow=(src&0x3F)<<2
*   Overflow from each source byte is OR-merged into the next dest byte.
*   The effective output width is (sprite_width + 1) bytes when subbyte>0.
*
* Apple II port note: Apple II has 7 pixels per byte (1bpp), so L1A84
* dispatches on 7 shift values (0-6) and uses 1-bit shift units. CoCo3
* has 4 pixels per byte (2bpp), so 4 shift values (0-3) with 2-bit units.
* The LSR/ROR mechanics are identical in structure; only the number of
* shift cases and bits-per-shift differ.
*
* Cycle estimate per source byte (static analysis):
*   subbyte=0: ~10 cy (lda ,x+ + sta ,y+ + loop overhead)
*   subbyte=1: ~47 cy (2×LSR + 2×ROR + OR-blend + overflow handling)
*   subbyte=2: ~55 cy (4×LSR + 4×ROR + OR-blend + overflow)
*   subbyte=3: ~63 cy (6×LSR + 6×ROR + OR-blend + overflow)
* For a 4-byte × 10-row sprite at subbyte=1: ~1880 cycles.
*

*   PAGE_A_TOKEN ($20) → buffer A ($8000-$BBFF)
*   PAGE_B_TOKEN ($40) → buffer B ($C000-$FBFF)

* HAL_gfx_blit_sprite_mixed — per-REGION mixed-opacity blit (ADDITIVE).
*   Splits a sprite into byte-COLUMN runs; each run is blitted OPAQUE (index-0
*   stored solid) or TRANSPARENT (index-0 keyed) per a descriptor. It WRAPS the
*   existing transparent + opaque blits — their optimized loops are UNCHANGED,
*   so every existing caller stays byte-identical. Reusable: any sprite with
*   region-separable opacity supplies its own run descriptor. NO pixel-format
*   change (2bpp preserved) — the opacity lives in the descriptor, not the data.
*
* Args: X = sprite (height,width,bitmap); A = dest byte col; B = dest row;
*       blit_subbyte ($0C) set; U = descriptor ptr.
* Descriptor: repeating RECTANGLE entries
*       fcb start_col, width, start_row, num_rows, opaque(0=transp,1=opaque)
*       terminated by a width byte of 0. (Row-bands, column-runs, or cells.)
* Per region: extract the rectangle [start_col..+width) x [start_row..+num_rows)
*       to MIX_SCRATCH, then blit via the existing leaf at dest
*       (A+start_col, B+start_row), same sub-byte.
* Uses mix_* ZP ($14-$20) which the inner blits do not touch; blit_subbyte
*       persists across regions (the blits read it, never write it).

* ---------------------------------------------------------------
* HAL_gfx_blit_sprite_masked — opaque blit with a per-COLUMN POSITIONAL mask
*   (ADDITIVE, sub-byte precision, NO format change). Where the existing mixed
*   blit splits opacity at BYTE boundaries, this splits it at the PIXEL within a
*   byte: each source byte is merged with the caller's mask byte for that column
*   via the SAME engine the transparent/opaque blits use — result =
*   (dest AND ~mask) OR source. mask bit-pair = 11 -> take source (opaque),
*   00 -> keep dest (transparent). So a column can be opaque on some pixels and
*   transparent on others (e.g. trim a 1px edge off an otherwise-solid byte).
*
*   Like the transparent blit, kept-dest (mask=00) pixels rely on source being
*   index-0 there (the OR contributes 0) — true for black edges/keying.
*
* Args: X = sprite (height,width,bitmap); A = dest byte col; B = dest row;
*       U = mask array ptr (one mask byte per source column, width bytes).
* BYTE-ALIGNED ONLY (no sub-byte shift) — the feet use blit_subbyte=0.
* Reuses blit_height/width/col/row/tmp + mix_data ($18) for the mask base.
* Preserves nothing extra; clobbers A,B,X,Y,U,CC. Bounds-checked like the others.

* HAL_gfx_blit_stencil_punch — punch a per-PIXEL 2D silhouette to black.
*   (ADDITIVE.) Unlike HAL_gfx_blit_sprite_masked (per-COLUMN mask, reset each
*   row), this walks a FULL 2D mask (width*height bytes, advancing continuously)
*   and writes: dest = dest AND ~mask. Mask bit-pair 11 -> force pixel black
*   (occlude), 00 -> keep dest. Used to occlude a moving actor behind Akuma's
*   exact figure silhouette (mask from fig_974B: 11=figure, 00=surround+gaps),
*   trimmed to his shape (not a rectangle) incl. the interior armpit gaps.
* Args: X = stencil (height,width,maskbytes); A = dest byte col; B = dest row.
* BYTE-ALIGNED. Bounds-checked like the others. Clobbers A,B,X,Y,CC.

* HAL_gfx_blit_scroll  [R-p26 — full-region scroll blit]
*
* Like HAL_gfx_blit_sprite, but targets a 16-bit physical row (0-391)
* in the COMBINED display region ($8000-$FBFF = physical $78000-$7FBFF,
* CPU- and physically-contiguous), with NO 192-row bounds check. Used by
* the scene-4 VOFFSET sliding-window scroll, which renders lines into a
* ~392-row ring buffer spanning both frame buffers (legal: the display is
* single-buffered per R-p25, so both buffers form one scroll region).
*
* Args:    X = sprite ptr (height,width,bitmap)
*          A = destination byte column (0-79; 4px/byte)
*          s4_dest_row ($66, 16-bit) = destination physical row (0-391)
*          blit_subbyte ($0C) = sub-byte offset 0-3 (CALLER sets)
* Returns: CC.C clear. Preserves U. Clobbers A,B,X,Y,CC,$0D/$0E.
*
* dest = $8000 + row*80 + col. row*80 with row<=391 ($187): row_lo*80
* (<=20400) + (row_hi ? 80<<8 : 0). Shares the sub-byte dispatch/row-loops
* with HAL_gfx_blit_sprite (blit_do_sb0..3 above; row stride is #80).
* Caller guarantees row+height <= 392 and col+width(+1) <= 80.

* blit_trans_table — 256-byte transparency mask lookup table
*
* Maps each possible source byte to its transparency mask:
*   2bpp pixel pair (2 bits) non-zero → mask bits = 11 (replace dest)
*   2bpp pixel pair zero              → mask bits = 00 (preserve dest)
*
* Table layout uses signed-B indexed addressing trick:
*   U = blit_trans_table_mid (= table_base + 128)
*   lda b,u: B $00-$7F (positive) → accesses [mid+0..mid+127] = masks $00-$7F
*            B $80-$FF (negative) → accesses [mid-128..mid-1]  = masks $80-$FF
*
* Physical memory order:
*   Offset 0-127   (blit_trans_table_base): masks for source bytes $80-$FF
*   Offset 128-255 (blit_trans_table_mid):  masks for source bytes $00-$7F
