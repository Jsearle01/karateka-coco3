*
* HAL System subsystem — P2.3a.0 deliverable.
*
* Purpose:
*   Handler dispatch block at $0100-$0111 (static RTI stubs;
*     loaded into RAM by DECB; CoCo3 $FExx chain routes here).
*   HAL_sys_init: CoCo3 bare-metal transition (mask + $FF90 + MMU).
*   HAL_sys_panic: Unrecoverable error handler (infinite loop).
*
* ORIGIN: HAL_sys_init is new karateka-coco3 work. Not ported from
*   GFXMODE3.ASM. Designed for CoCo3 bare-metal transition per P2.3a.0.
*
* CoCo3 INTERRUPT DISPATCH (three-level; per Sockmaster-GIME §1):
*   CPU reads from $FFxx (ROM — unchangeable).
*   $FFxx ROM values contain $FExx addresses (BASIC-installed secondary
*     vectors). After $FF90=$4C is written, MC3=1 locks $FExx as
*     "constant" — they cannot be overwritten.
*   $FExx values contain JMPs/LBRAs to $01xx (the dispatch block below).
*   This binary provides RTI stubs at $0100-$010F so that if an
*     interrupt fires despite ORCC #$50 masking, the CPU safely returns.
*
*   HAL_sys_init does NOT write vectors at runtime. The dispatch block
*   is statically allocated at .org $0100 in this file and loaded into
*   RAM by DECB. BASIC's $FExx routing remains in effect (locked by
*   MC3=1 in $FF90=$4C).
*
*   Per Sockmaster-GIME §1 (docs/SockmasterGime.md):
*     SWI3 → $FFF2(ROM) → $FEEE → $0100
*     SWI2 → $FFF4(ROM) → $FEF1 → $0103
*     SWI  → $FFFA(ROM) → $FEFA → $0106
*     NMI  → $FFFC(ROM) → $FEFD → $0109
*     IRQ  → $FFF8(ROM) → $FEF7 → $010C
*     FIRQ → $FFF6(ROM) → $FEF4 → $010F

*
* INTERRUPT MASK POLICY (P2.3a.0 era):
*   Three-layer protection:
*     Layer 1: Test driver global ORCC #$50 at entry
*     Layer 2: HAL_sys_init internal ORCC #$50 (belt-and-suspenders)
*     Layer 3: Dispatch block RTI stubs (safe no-op if interrupt fires)
*   This is acceptable while no interrupt-driven behavior exists.
*   Migration required when real handlers land (P3.1 VBL at minimum).
*   [ref: docs/conventions.md — "Interrupt mask policy" section]
*   [ref: docs/open-questions.md Q001 — migration plan]
*   [ref: docs/interrupt-handling.md — full dispatch documentation]
*
* PRODUCTION BUILD NOTE:
*   The dispatch block at .org $0100 and the HAL code (HAL_sys_init,
*   HAL_sys_panic) are in separate address regions ($0100 and HAL
*   $2000-$3FFF respectively). A production linker script will place
*   the two sections correctly. For test drivers (lwasm --decb single-
*   file builds), both sections appear in the binary via multiple .org
*   directives. This file is the authoritative source for both; the
*   production build wiring is deferred to post-P2.

* HAL_sys_init
*
* CoCo3 bare-metal transition: mask interrupts, enable all-RAM mode,
* program MMU task 0 to P1.6 layout.
*
* ORIGIN: New karateka-coco3 work (P2.3a.0). Not from GFXMODE3.ASM.
*
* Args:    none
* Returns: CC.C clear; CC.I=1, CC.F=1 (interrupts remain MASKED)
* Preserves: U, Y
* Clobbers: A, X, CC
* Precondition: BASIC boot complete; DP=0; stack initialized
* Postcondition:
*   - Interrupts masked (ORCC #$50 applied)
*   - $FF90=$4C: COCO=0, MMUEN=1, MC3=1, MC2=1 (all-RAM; MMU enabled;
*       $FExx locked by MC3=1; ROM unmapped from $8000-$FEFF)
*   - FFA0-FFA7=$38-$3F: MMU task 0 mapped to P1.6 layout
*       ($0000-$1FFF=physical $70000, ..., $C000-$FFFF=physical $7C000+)
*   - HAL_sys_init does NOT install interrupt vectors. Dispatch block
*       RTI stubs at $0100-$010F are loaded by DECB. BASIC's $FExx
*       secondary vectors remain in effect (MC3=1 locks them).
*
* Interrupt masking rationale:
*   $FF90=$4C unmaps ROM from $8000-$FEFF, invalidating ROM interrupt
*   handlers. Masking before the write ensures no interrupt fires
*   during the transition window when vectors point to invalidated ROM.

HAL_sys_init:

* Step 1: Mask interrupts immediately.
* ROM interrupt handlers will be invalidated by $FF90 write in step 2.
* Must not take an interrupt during transition. Belt-and-suspenders:
* caller (test driver) should also mask before calling HAL_sys_init.

        orcc    #$50                    ; set CC.I (IRQ mask) and CC.F (FIRQ mask)

* Step 2: Enable all-RAM mode + MMU.
* MC3=1 locks $FExx secondary vectors; they retain BASIC's routing to
* $01xx dispatch block. MC2=1 = standard SCS. MMUEN=1 enables MMU.
* COCO=0 switches from SAM-mode to GIME-mode address translation.
